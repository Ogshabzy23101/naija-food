            <h5>cooking rice</h5>

            One of the main meals of the globe, rice is prepared in millions of
            families every day, but some individuals believe they can't cook it
            properly. If you follow a few basic guidelines and use the
            appropriate cooking technique for your rice variety, cooking rice is
            a straightforward task. We promise that if you follow this, you
            won't ever again create a clumpy, sticky, or glutinous mess. There
            are just two guidelines: First of all, estimating the volume of rice
            makes determining the appropriate amount of water easier. Second,
            rice will break apart and get sticky if you stir it while it cooks.
            A knob of butter or a teaspoon of oil is frequently added at the
            beginning of several recipes to aid in the separation of the grains
            before
            <h5>Types of rice and how to cook them</h5>

            Basmati rice and other long-grain rices should be washed to remove
            any extra starch before boiling or cooking by absorption. Cooking
            brown rice takes longer and requires more water than white rice. It
            will cook more quickly if you soak it in cold water for at least 30
            minutes and even up to several hours. Add 1.5 times as much water if
            you want to utilise the following approach. For more information on
            brown rice cooking, go to our guide. Don't rinse short-grain rice;
            the starch from the rice is needed to make the finished meal creamy
            in risotto, paella and rice pudding. The rice is cooked alongside
            the other components in these recipes.

          <article class="ques-text">
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <li>2 cups of Nigerian brown or black-eyed beans</li>
            <li>Water for soaking and cooking</li>
            <li>Onion (1 medium-sized), chopped</li>
            <li>Red palm oil (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Seasoning cubes or powder (optional)</li>
            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <h5>1. Sorting and Soaking:</h5>
            <li>
              Spread the beans on a flat surface and remove any dirt or debris.
            </li>
            <li>Rinse the beans thoroughly under running water.</li>
            <li>
              Place the beans in a large bowl and cover with enough water to
              allow for swelling. Let it soak for at least 4-6 hours or
              overnight. This helps soften the beans and reduce cooking time.
            </li>
            <h5>2. Rinsing:</h5>
            <li>
              After soaking, drain and rinse the beans under running water.
            </li>
            <h5>3. Cooking:</h5>
            <li>Transfer the rinsed beans to a pot or pressure cooker.</li>
            <li>Add enough water to cover the beans by a couple of inches.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onions and a pinch of salt to the pot.</li>
            <li>
              If desired, add a small amount of red palm oil for flavor. This is
              optional but commonly used in Nigerian cuisine. If you're using a
              pressure cooker, follow the manufacturer's instructions for
              cooking beans. Typically, it takes about 15-20 minutes after
              reaching pressure. For a regular pot, it might take 1-2 hours
              until the beans are soft. Add more water if necessary.
            </li>

            <h5>4. Seasoning:</h5>
            <li>
              Season the beans with salt and any other preferred seasonings like
              bouillon cubes or powder. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
            </li>
            <h5>5. Final Touch:</h5>
            <li>
              Continue cooking until the beans are soft and have reached your
              desired consistency. Some people prefer their beans firmer, while
              others like it softer.
            </li>
            <h5>6. Serve:</h5>
            <li>
              Once the beans are cooked, serve it as a side dish or as part of a
              main course. It's commonly enjoyed with rice, bread, plantains, or
              yams.
            </li>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <li>
              You can add other ingredients like tomatoes, peppers, and spices
              for added flavor.
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li>
              Be cautious with salt, as beans take longer to cook if salt is
              added at the beginning of the cooking process.
            </li>
            <li>
              If using a pressure cooker, follow safety guidelines and release
              pressure before opening the cooker.
            </li>
            <br>
            Adjust the recipe according to your preferences, and feel free to
            experiment with additional ingredients to make it your own. Enjoy
            your Nigerian beans!

            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
            <li>2 cups of Nigerian brown or black-eyed beans</li>
            <li>Water for soaking and cooking</li>
            <li>Onion (1 medium-sized), chopped</li>
            <li>Red palm oil (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Seasoning cubes or powder (optional)</li>
            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <h5>1. Sorting and Soaking:</h5>
            <li>
              Spread the beans on a flat surface and remove any dirt or debris.
            </li>
            <li>Rinse the beans thoroughly under running water.</li>
            <li>
              Place the beans in a large bowl and cover with enough water to
              allow for swelling. Let it soak for at least 4-6 hours or
              overnight. This helps soften the beans and reduce cooking time.
            </li>
            <h5>2. Rinsing:</h5>
            <li>
              After soaking, drain and rinse the beans under running water.
            </li>
            <h5>3. Cooking:</h5>
            <li>Transfer the rinsed beans to a pot or pressure cooker.</li>
            <li>Add enough water to cover the beans by a couple of inches.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onions and a pinch of salt to the pot.</li>
            <li>
              If desired, add a small amount of red palm oil for flavor. This is
              optional but commonly used in Nigerian cuisine. If you're using a
              pressure cooker, follow the manufacturer's instructions for
              cooking beans. Typically, it takes about 15-20 minutes after
              reaching pressure. For a regular pot, it might take 1-2 hours
              until the beans are soft. Add more water if necessary.
            </li>

            <h5>4. Seasoning:</h5>
            <li>
              Season the beans with salt and any other preferred seasonings like
              bouillon cubes or powder. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
            </li>
            <h5>5. Final Touch:</h5>
            <li>
              Continue cooking until the beans are soft and have reached your
              desired consistency. Some people prefer their beans firmer, while
              others like it softer.
            </li>
            <h5>6. Serve:</h5>
            <li>
              Once the beans are cooked, serve it as a side dish or as part of a
              main course. It's commonly enjoyed with rice, bread, plantains, or
              yams.
            </li>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <li>
              You can add other ingredients like tomatoes, peppers, and spices
              for added flavor.
            </li>
            <li></li>
            <li>
              Be cautious with salt, as beans take longer to cook if salt is
              added at the beginning of the cooking process.
            </li>
            <li>
              If using a pressure cooker, follow safety guidelines and release
              pressure before opening the cooker.
            </li>

            <li>Transfer the rinsed beans to a pot or pressure cooker.</li>
            <li>Add enough water to cover the beans by a couple of inches.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onions and a pinch of salt to the pot.</li>
            <li>
              If desired, add a small amount of red palm oil for flavor. This is
              optional but commonly used in Nigerian cuisine. If you're using a
              pressure cooker, follow the manufacturer's instructions for
              cooking beans. Typically, it takes about 15-20 minutes after
              reaching pressure. For a regular pot, it might take 1-2 hours
              until the beans are soft. Add more water if necessary.
            </li>

            <h5>4. Seasoning:</h5>
            <li>
              Season the beans with salt and any other preferred seasonings like
              bouillon cubes or powder. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
            </li>
            <h5>5. Final Touch:</h5>
            <li>
              Continue cooking until the beans are soft and have reached your
              desired consistency. Some people prefer their beans firmer, while
              others like it softer.
            </li>
            <h5>6. Serve:</h5>
            <li>
              Once the beans are cooked, serve it as a side dish or as part of a
              main course. It's commonly enjoyed with rice, bread, plantains, or
              yams.

            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <li>
              You can add other ingredients like tomatoes, peppers, and spices
              for added flavor.

            <li></li>
            <li>
              Be cautious with salt, as beans take longer to cook if salt is
              added at the beginning of the cooking process.
            </li>
            <li>
              If using a pressure cooker, follow safety guidelines and release
              pressure before opening the cooker.
            </li>
